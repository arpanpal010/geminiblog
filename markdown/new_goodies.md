Got peripherials that are not supported ? The solution is simple, buy a new one or exchange them.

In my previous blog post shared that I had to use some *cough* legacy peripherials which in turn forced me to purchase a new keyboard and mouse that was known to work in FreeBSD.

The issue wasn't related to input drivers compiled with hal or evdev, neither have forgetten to add **hald_enable="YES"**.

This is my first LED keyboard. It's almost twice the size of my previous one. It's also heavy and the build quality is outstanding for the $20 price tag. There are 7 available colours, 5 programmable keys and much [more](http://pc-professional.info/keyboards/wired-keyboards/856-element-keyboard-kb1000g.html).

I bet that you can't guess what colour my keyboard is using now. The colour starts with **p** and ends with **ink**.

The [mouse](http://pc-professional.info/mice/wired-mice/859-ms-1050g.html) was just $2 and all I did was to hurry to grab one and put it in my shopping basket.

Also purchased two 8GB usb sticks that act as redundant LUKS backup for certain files that I value the most.
